                "The CICE tuning is primarily achieved by adjusting the snow grain radius, which impacts the surface albedo through the radiative transfer calculation. The base value for dry snow (rsnw_nonmelt) is 500 microns, and a predefined standard deviation (rsnw_std) of 250 microns from observations is used for tuning in the following: rsnw = rsnw_nonmelt - r_snw*rsnw_std, where r_snw is adjusted for tuning and by default in our simulations is 1.25. Hence, the starting dry snow grain radius is 500-1.25*250 = 187.5 microns. Once melting starts (determined by dt_mlt), the snow grain radius grows linearly until it achieves a maximum snow grain radius at 0C. Currently, melting begins at dt_mlt = -1.5C and the maximum snow grain radius (rsnw_mlt) is 1500 microns. Tuning of the r_snw value and also sometimes dt_mlt and the maximum snow grain radius value is used to adjust the surface albedo. This is typically done to reach a reasonable sea ice thickness and summer snow cover in pre-industrial control simulations, where \"reasonable\" is based on expert judgement. "
