                "The Community Land Model version 5 (CLM5) is the land model for the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2).  Documentation including model diagnostics, references, technical description is available here: http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2/land/.   CLM5 is documented in Lawrence et al. (2019) and references within.  A full Technical Description of the model is available here: https://escomp.github.io/ctsm-docs/doc/build/html/tech_note/index.html\n\nThe model formalizes and quantifies concepts of ecological climatology. Ecological climatology is an interdisciplinary framework to understand how natural and human changes in vegetation affect climate. It examines the physical, chemical, and biological processes by which terrestrial ecosystems affect and are affected by climate across a variety of spatial and temporal scales. The central theme is that terrestrial ecosystems, through their cycling of energy, water, chemical elements, and trace gases, are important determinants of climate. The land surface is a critical interface through which climate change impacts humans and ecosystems and through which humans and ecosystems can effect global environmental change.\n\nThe model represents many aspects of the land surface including surface heterogeneity and consists of components or submodels related to land biogeophysics, the hydrologic cycle, biogeochemistry, human dimensions, and ecosystem dynamics. Specific processes that are represented are listed in next box.\n\n\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                  \n"

                "Spatial land surface heterogeneity in CLM is represented as a nested subgrid hierarchy in which grid cells are composed of multiple land units, snow/soil columns, and Plant Functional Types (PFTs). Each grid cell can have a different number of land units, each land unit can have a different number of columns, and each column can have multiple PFTs. The first subgrid level, the land unit, is intended to capture the broadest spatial patterns of subgrid heterogeneity. The current land units are glacier, lake, urban, vegetated, and crop (when the crop model option is turned on). The land unit level can be used to further delineate these patterns. For example, the urban land unit is divided into density classes representing the tall building district, high density, and medium density urban areas.  The second subgrid level, the column, is intended to capture potential variability in the soil and snow state variables within a single land unit. For example, the vegetated land unit could contain several columns with independently evolving vertical profiles of soil water and temperature. Similarly, the managed vegetation land unit can be divided into two columns, irrigated and non-irrigated.  The central characteristic of the column subgrid level is that this is where the state variables for water and energy in the soil and snow are defined, as well as the fluxes of these components within the soil and snow. Regardless of the number and type of PFTs occupying space on the column, the column physics operates with a single set of upper boundary fluxes, as well as a single set of transpiration fluxes from multiple soil levels. These boundary fluxes are weighted averages over all PFTs. Currently, for lake and vegetated land units, a single column is assigned to each land unit. The crop land unit is split into irrigated and unirrigated columns with a single crop occupying each column. The urban land units have five columns (roof, sunlit walls and shaded walls, and pervious and impervious canyon floor). The glacier land unit is separated into up to 10 elevation classes. The land/sea mask is defined by the CESM ocean model.  Except for glacier land units, each land grid cell has just one elevation, which is defined by the atmosphere model."

PFTs are classified into three distinct phenological types that are represented by separate algorithms: an evergreen type, for which some fraction of annual leaf growth persists in the displayed pool for longer than one year; a seasonal-deciduous type with a single growing season per year, controlled mainly by temperature and daylength; and a stress-deciduous type with the potential for multiple growing seasons per year, controlled by temperature and soil moisture conditions. The three phenology types share a common set of control variables. The calculation of the phenology fluxes is generalized, operating identically for all three phenology types, given a specification of the common control variables.\nhttps://escomp.github.io/ctsm-docs/doc/build/html/tech_note/Vegetation_Phenology_Turnover/CLM50_Tech_Note_Vegetation_Phenology_Turnover.html\n\nThe crop model uses the AgroIBIS crop phenology algorithm (Kucharik and Brye 2003), consisting of three distinct phases.

                "The representation of the nitrogen cycle in CLM5, originally based on Biome-BGC, is substantially modified relative to CLM4 and CLM4.5. First, recognizing that leaf nitrogen content is dynamic, implementation of  \u201cFlexCN\u201d functionality affords flexible plant stoichiometry and thus a single realized GPP calculation (as opposed to separate potential and actual fluxes). Second, recognizing that foliar photosynthetic capacity responds to environmental conditions and changes over space and time, the Leaf Utilization of Nitrogen for Assimilation (LUNA) module provides a prognostic optimization of maximum leaf-level carboxylation and electron transport rates.  Third, recognizing that changes in nitrogen supply or demand have consequences for plant productivity, the Fixation and Uptake of Nitrogen (FUN) module calculates the carbon costs of various nitrogen acquisition strategies and adjusts carbon expenditure on N uptake among biological fixation, active uptake, and retranslocation. Note, as currently implemented the plant C costs calculated by FUN only serve as an additional source of autotrophic respiration, not as an actual belowground C flux to roots or mycorrhizae that interacts with the soil biogeochemistry simulated in CLM5. Collectively, FlexCN, LUNA, and FUN more mechanistically represent plant nitrogen dynamics in CLM5 and afford opportunities to understand, refine, and improve simulated C-N biogeochemical dynamics.   Competition between plant and microbial nitrogen demand can be resolved. Mineral nitrogen in the soil pool at the beginning of the timestep is considered the available supply. The theoretical maximum demand for nitrogen by plants to meet the entire carbon uptake given an N cost of zero (and therefore represents the upper bound on N requirements). N uptake costs that are > 0 imply that the plant will take up less N that it demands, ultimately.  However, given the heuristic nature of the N competition algorithm, this discrepancy is not explicitly resolved here.  Soil carbon decomposition rates can be limited by the availability of  mineral nitrogen, but calculation of this limitation depends on first estimating the potential rates of decomposition, assuming an unlimited  mineral nitrogen supply.  Asymbiotic (or free living) N fixation is a function of evapotranspiration and is added to the inorganic nitrogen (NH4+) pool. Symbiotic N fixation is handled by the FUN model and is passed straight to the plant, not the mineral nitrogen pool.  Fertilizer is added to crops during the emergence phase.  See Sections 2.16, 2.18, 2.19, 2.21, 2.22, and 2.26 of the Technical Description for more details.  https://escomp.github.io/ctsm-docs/doc/build/html/tech_note/index.html"

MOSART assumes that all the tributaries within a spatial unit can be treated as a single hypothetical sub-network channel with a transport capacity equivalent to all the tributaries combined. Correspondingly, three routing processes are represented in MOSART: 1) hillslope routing: in each spatial unit, surface runoff is routed as overland flow into the sub-network channel, while subsurface runoff generated in the spatial unit directly enters the sub-network channel; 2) sub-network channel routing: the sub-network channel receives water from the hillslopes, routes water through the channel and discharges it into the main channel; 3) main channel routing: the main channel receives water from the sub-network channel and/or inflow, if any, from the upstream spatial units, and discharges the water to its downstream spatial unit or the ocean.  In MOSART, the travel velocities of water across hillslopes, sub-network and main channel are all estimated using Manning\u2019s equation. https://escomp.github.io/ctsm-docs/doc/build/html/tech_note/MOSART/CLM50_Tech_Note_MOSART.html"
